<h2>Why Cats?</h2>
<p>Here I will be discussing the reasons for why cats are the superior creature,
    and why you should adopt a cat TODAY!
</p> 
<ul><li><b>Cats are low maintenance.</b> 
    Maybe cats’ most alluring quality is that they are lower maintenance and cost less than dogs, 
    who need walking, training, frequent grooming, and more toys and attention. 
    Cats are also perfect for apartments or city living. 
    They don’t need tons of space to play and explore—nosing their 
    way through the nooks and crannies of your kitchen will keep them occupied for hours.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>They’re quiet.</b>
    Cats tend to meow when they’re hungry, 
    but you rarely have to worry about being woken up or distracted 
    from a task by a cat begging for attention. 
    This makes them an ideal pet if you’re working from home or have youngsters napping during the day, 
    for example.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>They’re independent.</b>
    A cat will be there for you when you need them but they’re also perfectly 
    adept at entertaining themselves. Most don’t need—or want—constant attention 
    and you’ll never have to endure guilt-inducing puppy eyes from a cat.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>They keep your house pest-free.</b>
    You probably already know that cats like to hunt rodents. 
    But they’re also natural insect killers, too, 
    offering the kind of household protection that Venus flytraps promise but rarely deliver. 
    Many cats thoroughly enjoy exterminating bugs such as house flies and spiders, 
    almost like they’re being paid for it.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b> They have long life spans.</b>
    The most difficult stage of pet ownership is parting with your beloved companion.
     While you’re still likely to outlive a cat, 
     their longer lifespans mean you’ll get to have more time with them—up to 20 years, 
     in fact.</li></ul>
